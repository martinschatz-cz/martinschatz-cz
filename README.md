- 👋 Hi, I’m Martin Schätz (@martinschatz-cz)
- 👀 I’m interested in BioImage Analysis, signal and image processing and Open Science. I am curently working at University of Chemistry and Technology as Assistant Professor and in Open Access Microscopy core facility [vmcf-konfmi](https://github.com/vmcf-konfmi), Science Faculty, Charles University. You can find more about my research on [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0931-4017).

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of BioImage Analysis problems, machine and deep learning validation for reproducibility and in general on any kind of framework for reproducible data science.
- ✨ Check out my YOLOv5 based object detection and counting project focused on scientific images: [SciCount](https://github.com/martinschatz-cz/SciCount)
